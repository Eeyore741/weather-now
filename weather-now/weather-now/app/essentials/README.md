## Overview
Going from top to bottom 

##Application
Contains of: 

###WNAppDelegate class
WNAppDelegate is a main entrance/exit point for the app. Works as dependency injector for root view controller (WNViewController) and model (WNPredictionModel).
Weather prediction domain specific dependencies (DarkSky url & token) provided by xcconfig file (default.xcconfig).

###WNViewController class
Weater Now contains of one logicless view controller WNViewController relying on model.

###WNPredictionModel class
Model provided by WNPredictionModel relies on geolocation & weather prediction providers via app specific protocols.

##Protocols

###WNVisuallyLockable protocol
WNVisuallyLockable protocol with UIView extension provides "locking with message" functionality.

###WNLocationProvider protocol
WNLocationProvider is the app specific protocol providing geolocation service api functionality.

###WNLocation protocol
WNLocation is the app specific protocol providing one specific geolocation data.

###WNPredictionProvider protocol
WNPredictionProvider is the app specific protocol providing weather prediction service api functionality.

###WNPrediction protocol
WNPrediction is the app specific protocol providing one specific weather prediction data.

##Domains

###HardwareLocationService class
HardwareLocationService is iOS domain specific class that works on pair with CoreLocation and provides simplified device geolocation api.

###DarkSkyPredictionService class
DarkSkyPredictionService is DarkSky.net domain specific class providing acces to weather prediction api

###DarkSkyPrediction struct
DarkSkyPrediction represents DarkSky.net domain specific prediction data model

###DarkSkyWeather struct
DarkSkyWeather represents DarkSky.net domain specific weather data model
